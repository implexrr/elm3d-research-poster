# Elm3D_Camp_Research_Poster
Research Poster for McMaster University's Summer 2020 Research Presentation

From May - August of 2020, I worked full time as a research assistant at McMaster University's Department of Computing and Software under the supervision of Dr. Christopher Anand. During this time, I worked along aside a team of undergraduate/graduate researchers to create lessons and summer camp curricula to teach students in grades 4-12 the fundamentals of functional programming and algebraic thinking. Together, we developed a 3D-graphics API in Elm that allowed students to collaborate and create a multiplayer 3D Bee Game. My role in particular was the creation of a day-night cycle (yet to be integrated into the main game, hopefully we get around to this in summer 2021), the organization of camp materials, training the other undergraduate researchers and the creation of camp lessons.

Special thanks to Dr. Christopher Anand and Christopher Schankula for the development of GraphicsSVG, which was used frequently during this camp. The repository for their library is here: https://github.com/MacCASOutreach/graphicsvg, and to Ian MacKenzie, whose work with the Elm 3D library made this all possible. The repository for his work can be found here: https://github.com/ianmackenzie/elm-3d-scene
Thank you for visiting!
